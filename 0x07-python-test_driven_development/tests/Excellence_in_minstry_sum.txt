Good afternoon Pastor

Thank you very much for the privilege to share on this platform. I do not take it for granted Sir

I will be sharing from Pastor's teaching - Excellence in Ministry

Pastor started with explaining the at there are information written to leadership in the epistles of Paul, letter to Timothy, Titus and Philemon, these are letter written for leadership,  exploring other books, we see that whenever and instruction is passed, sometimes we don't get it, if you read the epistles outside that context and you are not in the local assembly, and you are not committed to one, they will be half understood.

Pastor pointed to an example, of Paul when he says "if you say to the church" it implies structure, Matthew 18, when Jesus says tell it to the church, Eklesia is a structured body, which has those who are in charge, those instructions are firstly for leaders, 1st Corinthians the letters are to the church but through the leadership.
letters to Rome, Romans 15, Paul addresses leadership, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, also the book of Hebrews spoke about those who are elders Hebrew 7:17, Hebrew 12:23-24
Pastor said that there is always that information that relates to the elders of the church
James 5:14, 1st Peter 5:1, 
Revelation,  there is always that part of the doctrine of Christ that  addresses those who are in different capacities of responsibility, Revelation 2:3, to the angles of the churches, that is the instructions are delivered to the messenger and then given to the churches, it's just the way the Lord has structured the church.

Pastor points to the four gospels, where they had different kind of meetings, where Jesus called the twelve, and then after the resurrection, He gave information to He's disciples,  and they didn't go out talking about those meetings, they kept those information, 
Luke 24:49, Acts 1:8, 
They had been trained to know when to talk, training also teaches you not just what to say but when and where to say them, imagine going to meeting and not putting it on facebook,

Pastor said, this gives us the character of God, where He keeps and information when you don't need it, it's only a gossip that can say anything anywhere. Jesus taught them everyday, John 21, they didn't talk about it, they were discrete in the way they learned, true training has a lot of discretion to it, you are not trying to show off, you are just learning, building capacity in your life, and through your life, the results are what is important, they met Jesus, 
Acts 1:14 - 16, and they were praying, they didn't announce it, then when the Holy Ghost came on them, 
Acts 2:1-4, then they preached and had three thousand,

Pastor says that sometimes, if we pay attention enough there are certain things we have done Wrongly and at the wrong time, then you begin to struggle, but its the Lord that sent you, yes, but did he send you to do it, at that time and where you did it?

In the book of Acts we find meetings that were selective Acts 15, we had apostles and the  elders, there are such meetings that are based on responsibilities, the kind of responsibilities that are given to you,  Acts 15, they were discoursing about the mission to reach the gentile, 
Acts 20:17,
Paul called for the elders ofo Ephesus, in Acts 20: 20, Pastor said the moment you don't get the context you won't see the point, when Paul said "it is more blessed to give than to receive" those are words for leadership. So you can say there were different ministers conferences, one  of them is Acts 15, where Paul and Silas where send to the church in Asia, another
Acts 8:1-4 
People were sent, so after such meetings there is an instruction for people to carry out a Mandate.

Pastor explained that your personal life is not outside the purview of the pastor's office, he pointed to letters in the epistles that address taking care of your children, husband and wife, employers, and employee,
Hebrew 13:17, 
the word souls there means your life which include what you do.

Pastor says when your pastor, is talking to you, even about issues in the natural, when he intervenes on matters that might have a natural side, but he lets you see the spiritual side,  you have to listen, because that's God talking to you, you have to listen.

2 Timothy 2:1-2
Pastor explained that this text is not just doctrine that the word, witness has to do with  evidence, it means something that can corroborate another thing, something that can stand it it's place, Acts 8, 
Luke 24:48
Paul is saying there are many witnesses, in other words when you are in leadership, it says Commit the same to faithful men who shall be able to teach other, which include he's teaching,  he's life, he's pursuit, 
2 Timothy 6:10

Pastor lets us know that, usually we use the privileges as rights, and we are not different from one another, 
Genesis 1:26-28 God made humanity for the same thing, the only difference are the times each persons shows up, so what every capacity that i am, i must see myself, as first among equals, where I have to lead, parent, father, mother,  I’m only first among equals. The privileges that come to you are because you are there to serve, God brings us into the world using relationships to mirror he's own responsibilities. Everything I'm doing God can do them, because others can do them too, there is non of us that is indispensable, 
Pastor says you start to treat life’s advantages as privileges not as entitlements, every day is not a right, Relationships have a supernatural aspect to them that we must embrace; they are a privilege to be a blessing to others, the reason why people show you honor is not because you are better it's because God chose you,
Deuteronomy  7:7 Exodus 19:5-6, Israel is only special because God is using them and God is not using them because they are special.
Honor is not for me to take, it's for me to give, I mustn't use God's honor as a weapon, meaning i must not get in the way of people so that i don't begin to site honor rather that deserve it, I must be an example, i should be God's servant in reality as an example, honor is for others to receive and not for me to take.
Acts 20:28
Pastor explains what is means to "take heed", it means you make investments into your life, Pastor defines leadership as the summation of the investment you have made into your spiritual life and personality which should influence others and bear fruit in their lives, your leadership is not positional, your leadership is influential, in other words your spiritual growth is tied to people's destinies. Paul’s says take heed to your self
1 Timothy 4:15-16
As i meditate on the word of God I’m taking heed to my spiritual life it blesses me, but beyond me it blesses others, Pastor says there something you must always think about, all you see yourself as a vessel, your talent, your gifting’s, your physical attraction. The moment you lose track of service, you are an idol worshiper. Pastor says that talent is not enough, gift is not enough, you need character, good character, you need it everywhere, in the home, marriage, business, in the church. Personality is what you build, so we invest in our personality.
Build your spiritual life strongly, you have to keep investing in your life, it going to reflect in your conduct and in all circumstances, don't run away from experiences that will build you,
Pastor says you are going to lead people you don't know now, you are going to lead people that you will never know, but ensure you are ready to lead, God gave you responsibility through the man of God placed in your life, we must invest in our conduct, invest in spiritual warfare, adverse circumstance will make you pray the more, 

2 Timothy 2:1
you have to be strong, your work is a spiritual warfare, you must invest in your life, Pastor emphasis on the things must always be in your heart, your vision, your vision is where you are going to, never lose your vision, when your vision is gone then your are gone, your vision is what you see, spend time in prayer for your cell. Pastor says the Christian faith works with spiritual laws not logic, you break them you suffer for it, don't abandon the flock.
Pastor says when you live for God the world will call you extreme. My vision must never be distracted, never let anything take your vision, as a leader you must learn to communicate your vision. I must never take mediocrity, mediocrity is accepting the circumstance the way it is and not willing to push further with what it ought to be. We pray and fast to push out mediocrity out of our ministry.

Thank you very much for the privilege Sir
